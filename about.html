    <div class="education">
      <div class="introduction">
        <p>
          I am a passionate BSc (Computer Science) student currently in my first
          year, with a keen interest in technology and creativity. Alongside my
          studies, I have developed a strong enthusiasm for video editing, where
          I enjoy combining technical skills with artistic expression to create
          engaging content.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have already completed several video editing projects, showcasing my
          ability to bring ideas to life through visuals.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I continue to learn and grow, I aim to enhance my expertise in both
          computer science and video editing, pursuing opportunities to innovate
          and contribute to exciting projects.

        <h3>Current Studies</h3>
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Computer
          Science, and I am in the first year of my program.
        </p>
        <p>
          This course allows me to delve deeper into the world of technology and
          computing, where I am building a strong foundation in programming,
          algorithms, and data structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am excited about the opportunities this field offers and am looking
          forward to developing my skills and knowledge to become proficient in
          the rapidly evolving world of computer science.

        <h3>Past Studies</h3>
        <p>
          I recently completed my Class 12th education from the CBSE board in
          Uttar Pradesh, specializing in the PCM (Physics, Chemistry, and
          Mathematics) stream.
        </p>
        <p>
          I achieved a score of 64% and gained valuable insights into the
          fundamentals of science and mathematics during my studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          This milestone has strengthened my academic foundation and inspired me
          to explore new opportunities and challenges as I continue to grow and
          learn.

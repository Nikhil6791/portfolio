        <h3>Academics Studies</h3>
        <p>
            I recently completed my Class 12th education from the CBSE board in Uttar Pradesh, specializing in the PCM (Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics) stream. I achieved a score of 64% and gained valuable insights into the fundamentals of science and mathematics during my studies. This milestone has strengthened my academic foundation and inspired me to explore new opportunities and challenges as I continue to grow and learn.
